// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

Read numbers 
num1 =input(number)
num2 =inpeut(number)

sum = num1 + num2



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start Read the number
number = input(enter a number)

2. Check if number is even or odd
if the number %  2 == 0 then number is even
else
if the nubmer %  2 == 0 then number is odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum)
of the five entered numbers. 
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Read in five numbers 
num1 = input(number)
num2 = input(number)
num3 = input(number)
num4 = input(number)
num5 = input(nubmer)

2. Calculate the average of the five numbers 
average = (num1 = num2 + num3 + num4 + num5) / 5

3 Find the smallest and largest of the five numbers
smallest = min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
largest = max(num1, num2,num3, num4, num5)
outputlarg average of five numbers:, average)
output (smallest number, smallest)
output (largest number, largest)
